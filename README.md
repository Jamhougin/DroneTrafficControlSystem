# DroneTrafficControlSystem
4th year Software Development Final Project

The purpose of the Automated Drone Traffic Control System is to allow its user to operate a drone or fleet of drones without the need for constant input. The user can add any number of drones to the system as well as any number of locations for the drone to take off and land. The user may then use the system to schedule flights for the drones to take part in. Once the user begins a flight, the chosen drone will take off and fly to its destination automatically. The system is capable of performing multiple simultaneous flights with any number of drones. 


There are collision detection mechanisms in place to ensure that the drones do not collide with one another while in flight. The system also has the ability to abort any flight in case of emergency and direct drones to the nearest safe landing area.
